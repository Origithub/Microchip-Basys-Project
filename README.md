# Microchip-Basys-Project

This project includes implementing [Basys MX3](https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-mx3-pic32mx-trainer-board-for-embedded-systems-courses/).
One of the key features is that it takes an assembly written file [(timer.asm)](https://github.com/Origithub/Microchip-Basys-Project/blob/master/timer.asm), process it in the assembler and afterwards in the simulator that runs a precise timer (by knowing the frequency band and the amount of assembly instructions that needs to run per second).
